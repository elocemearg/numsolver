<h1>Quantum Tombola</h1>
<p>
This solves numbers games according to the rules of the TV show Countdown.
</p>
<p>
Enter a selection of numbers separated by spaces, and an optional target, in
the boxes above. Then press enter or click Go.
</p>
<p>
The selection is conventionally six numbers, but you can enter between two and
eight. All the numbers in the selection and target (if given) must be positive
integers.
</p>
<p>
If you enter a target, you'll see all the non-trivially different solutions for
that target, and the solution counts for nearby targets.
</p>
<p>
If you don't enter a target, you'll see a map of all the targets (101-999) at
once, colour coded by solveability with the given selection. Click on any
target to see the solutions for it.
</p>
<p>
If you're using a mobile device, you might find
<a href="/solver/index.html" target="_blank">this interface</a> easier to use, but it
doesn't have all the same features.
</p>

<h1>Shortcuts and special commands</h1>
<p>
The following shortcuts may be included in the selection box to modify the
behaviour of the solver.
</p>
<table class="shortcuts">
<tr>
    <td class="shortcut">4L</td>
    <td>Equivalent to <span style="font-family: monospace">100 75 50 25</span>.
        For example,
        <span style="font-family: monospace">4L 6 3</span> expands to
        <span style="font-family: monospace">100 75 50 25 6 3</span>.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td class="shortcut">fast</td>
    <td>Use the fast solver (see below) no matter how many numbers are in
        the selection. By default, the fast solver is only used when the
        selection contains more than 7 numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td class="shortcut">@<span style="font-style: italic">target</span></td>
    <td>Use <span style="font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;">target</span>
        as the target. Useful if you don't want the hassle of moving
        all the way over to the other box to type the target.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h1>Technical detail</h1>
<p>
This solver generates all legal expressions that can be made from the starting
numbers, subject to some optimisations. It keeps the expressions that reach
the target, or if it's not possible to reach the target, the expressions that
get the closest to it.
</p>
<p>
The solver should solve every puzzle perfectly. If you find a solution to a
puzzle which the solver claims is impossible, or you find a closer solution
than the closest one it finds, then that's a bug.
</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
The rules are as used by the numbers round on Countdown. The object of the game
is to use the starting numbers and any combination of addition, subtraction,
multiplication or division to reach the target number or as close as possible
to it.
</p>
<p>
You don't have to use all the numbers, but each number may be used only once.
Only positive integers may be used at any stage of the calculation. Negative
numbers, powers and fractions are not allowed.
</p>
<h2>All solutions</h2>
<p>
If you enter seven or fewer numbers in the selection, the solver will give
you all the non-trivially different solutions for a given target. The solver
considers two expressions to be equivalent, and therefore not different
solutions, if both expressions do the same operations on the same numbers when
their operations are rearranged into a standard order. This means you don't get
all the trivial rearrangements of the same solution.
</p>
<h2>Fast solver</h2>
<p>
If you enter eight numbers in the selection, we use the "fast" solver to save
time and memory. This agressively eliminates duplicate expressions by
considering two expressions to be equivalent if they reach the same target
with the same starting numbers. This mode only tells you whether each target is
possible, and gives one example solution. However, it cannot tell you if this
is the only solution or what other solutions may exist.
</p>
<h2>Useless operations</h2>
<p>
Trivially redundant operations which are never useful in the game are always
ignored and not included in the expression. This includes introducing more
operations to an expression after it has reached the target, multiplying or
dividing by 1, or any part of an expression being equivalent to
2x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;x or xÂ²&nbsp;/&nbsp;x.
